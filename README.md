## The project üöÄ
My first project with Unreal Engine 5. It is part of my learning and training of the engine. It is exclusively made in blueprints. The player can walk and fly across a realistic city (based on Epic's City Sample) as well as use 3 weapons : the famous repulsor, a classic missile and the powerful chest energy beam üí•

When flying, the player can trigger a boost mode and an hyperboost mode to fly faster and feel Iron-Man's power.

All the animations excepts the walking ones were made by me using an AI-powered motion capture tool : Plask.ai. I filmed myself doing the moves I wanted Iron-Man to do and the tool computes on the video to create an animation. Finally, I just have to use UE5's Rig retargetting tool to be able to use those animations on my desired skeleton.

This is still work-in-progress, I am working to finish the project soon and I plan to make a cool presentation video. So for the moment, I only have a few screenshots to showcase üòâ
